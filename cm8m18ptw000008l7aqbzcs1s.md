## What is Polymorphism? 🤔
Polymorphism is an OOP principle that allows one **method, function, or operator** to behave differently based on the context. It enables **code flexibility and reusability**.

### Real-Life Example 🌍:
A **person** 🧑 can have different roles:
- As a **student**, they study 📖.
- As a **friend**, they socialize 🗣️.
- As an **employee**, they work 💼.

Despite being the same person, they act differently in different situations. This is **polymorphism**!

## Types of Polymorphism 🔄

### 1️⃣ Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading) 🏗️
Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but with different **parameters**.

#### Example 📌:
```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10));      // Output: 15
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 10, 15));  // Output: 30
    }
}
```

### 2️⃣ Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding) 🎭
Method overriding allows a **child class** to provide a **different implementation** of a method that exists in the **parent class**.

#### Example 📌:
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
        myAnimal.makeSound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

## Method Overloading vs Method Overriding 🆚
| Feature           | Method Overloading 🏗️        | Method Overriding 🎭        |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Definition      | Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters | Redefining a method in a child class that exists in a parent class |
| Occurs At      | Compile-time              | Run-time                |
| Access Modifiers | Can have any modifier     | Cannot override `private`, `final`, or `static` methods |

## Why Use Polymorphism? 🤔
✅ **Code Flexibility**: The same function behaves differently based on input.  
✅ **Code Reusability**: Methods can be reused with different parameters.  
✅ **Extensibility**: New behaviors can be added without modifying existing code.

---

## Conclusion 🎯
Polymorphism makes OOP more **flexible, reusable, and scalable**. It allows the same code to work with different data types and behaviors, making it a key principle in software development! 🚀
