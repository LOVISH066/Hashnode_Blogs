Multitasking can be categorized into two types:
- **Process-Based Multitasking** 🖥️
- **Thread-Based Multitasking** 🧵

Both approaches allow multiple operations to run concurrently, but they differ in how they manage execution.

## 1. Process-Based Multitasking 🔄
- Each process has its own memory and resources.
- Switching between processes is slower due to high overhead.
- Used when tasks are independent of each other.

### Real-Life Example 💻🎶
While working on a laptop, you can listen to music, edit a document, and browse the web simultaneously. Each application runs as a separate process.

## 2. Thread-Based Multitasking ⚡
- Multiple threads share the same memory space.
- Switching between threads is faster due to lower overhead.
- Used when tasks share data and need efficient execution.

### Real-Life Example 🏗️
In a construction site, different workers (threads) perform tasks like painting, assembling, and wiring at the same time, sharing the same workspace.

## Code Example: Creating Multiple Threads in Java 📝
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion 🎯
- **Use process-based multitasking** for independent applications.
- **Use thread-based multitasking** when tasks share data and require efficient resource utilization.
