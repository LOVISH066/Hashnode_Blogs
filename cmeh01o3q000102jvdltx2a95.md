Databases are everywhere! From your favorite social media app to online shopping platforms, **databases** store and manage all the data that powers these applications. In this article, we’ll go through some essential concepts every developer should know.  

---

## ✅ 1. Introduction to Databases  
A **database** is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.  

**Why do we need databases?**  
- 🗄️ To store large amounts of data efficiently  
- ⚡ To retrieve data quickly  
- 🔐 To ensure security and consistency  

**Example:**  
Imagine an **online shopping app**. It needs to store:  
- User details 👤  
- Product details 🛍️  
- Orders and transactions 💳  

---

## ✅ 2. Schema & Three-Layer Abstraction  
The **three-layer architecture** helps in separating user interaction from the physical storage of data.  

### 🏗️ Layers of Database Architecture  
- **External Level**: How users view the data  
- **Conceptual Level**: How data is logically organized  
- **Internal Level**: How data is physically stored  

**Example:**  
When you order food on an app:  
- You see menu items (External)  
- The app organizes menus, prices, and orders (Conceptual)  
- Data is stored in tables inside a database (Internal)  

---

## ✅ 3. ACID Properties  
Databases must maintain **data integrity**. That’s where **ACID properties** come in:  

- **A – Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction succeed or none do  
- **C – Consistency**: Database remains in a valid state  
- **I – Isolation**: Multiple transactions do not affect each other  
- **D – Durability**: Once committed, changes are permanent  

**Example:**  
When transferring money:  
- Debit from one account ✅  
- Credit to another ✅  
Both should succeed together, or neither should happen.  

---

## ✅ 4. Installation of MS-SQL Server  
To work with **MS SQL Server**, you need to:  
- Download and install SQL Server from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)  
- Install **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** for managing databases  

💡 *Tip:* Always choose the **developer edition** for learning.  

---

## ✅ 5. DDL Commands  
**DDL (Data Definition Language)** commands are used to define and modify database structures.  

### ✏️ **CREATE Command**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);
