## Why Go Beyond Basic OOP? 🤔
Understanding **advanced OOP concepts** helps in writing **cleaner, more efficient, and scalable** software. These concepts enhance **modularity, maintainability, and flexibility** in complex applications.

---

## 1️⃣ Composition vs Inheritance 🔄
Instead of deep inheritance trees, **composition** promotes a "has-a" relationship over "is-a".

### ❌ Problem with Deep Inheritance:
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Eating..."); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Barking..."); }
}
class RobotDog extends Dog {
    void charge() { System.out.println("Charging battery..."); }
}
```
🔴 **Issue:** If `RobotDog` doesn’t need `bark()`, it still inherits it.

### ✅ Better Approach: Composition
```java
class Battery {
    void charge() { System.out.println("Charging..."); }
}
class RobotDog {
    private Battery battery = new Battery();
    void charge() { battery.charge(); }
}
```
✅ **Flexible, avoids unnecessary inheritance.**

---

## 2️⃣ Aggregation vs Composition 🏗️
Both represent **"has-a"** relationships, but with different lifetimes.

### 🔹 Aggregation (Weak Association):
- Child **can exist without** parent.
- Example: A `Team` **has players**, but players can exist independently.
```java
class Player {}
class Team {
    List<Player> players;
}
```

### 🔹 Composition (Strong Association):
- Child **cannot exist** without parent.
- Example: A `Car` **has an engine**, but the engine cannot exist separately.
```java
class Engine {}
class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine();
}
```
✅ **Choose wisely based on relationships in your application.**

## 3️⃣ Method Hiding vs Method Overriding 🆚
| Feature  | Method Overriding 🎭 | Method Hiding 🚫 |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Modifier | Works with instance methods | Works with static methods |
| Behavior | Runs method of child class | Runs method of parent class |
| Example  | `@Override` used | No `@Override` allowed |

### Example 📌:
```java
class Parent {
    static void show() { System.out.println("Parent static"); }
    void display() { System.out.println("Parent instance"); }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() { System.out.println("Child static"); } // Method hiding
    @Override
    void display() { System.out.println("Child instance"); } // Method overriding
}
```
✅ **Overriding enables polymorphism; method hiding doesn’t.**

---

## 4️⃣ Covariant Return Types 🎯
A subclass method **can return a more specific type** than the method in the parent class.

### Example 📌:
```java
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}
class Parent {
    Animal getAnimal() { return new Animal(); }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    Dog getAnimal() { return new Dog(); }
}
```
✅ **Allows type safety in overridden methods.**

---

## 5️⃣ Dependency Injection (DI) 💉
A design pattern where objects **receive dependencies from an external source**, instead of creating them internally.

### ❌ Without DI:
```java
class Service {
    void serve() { System.out.println("Serving..."); }
}
class Client {
    private Service service = new Service();
}
```
🔴 **Issue:** `Client` is tightly coupled with `Service`.

### ✅ With DI:
```java
class Client {
    private Service service;
    Client(Service service) { this.service = service; }
}
```
✅ **More flexibility, better testing, easier maintenance.**

---

## 6️⃣ Lazy vs Eager Initialization ⚡
| Feature  | Lazy Initialization 💤 | Eager Initialization ⚡ |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| When created? | When needed | At program start |
| Performance | Faster startup | Uses more memory |
| Example | Singleton pattern | Constant objects |

### Example 📌:
```java
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) instance = new Singleton();
        return instance;
    }
}
```
✅ **Improves memory usage & performance.**
