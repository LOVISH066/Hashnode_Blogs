A thread in Java goes through multiple states during its execution. Understanding these states helps in better thread management and debugging.

## 1. Thread States in Java 🚦
Java threads have the following lifecycle states:

| State        | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **New** | Thread is created but not started. |
| **Runnable** | Thread is ready to run but waiting for CPU allocation. |
| **Running** | Thread is currently executing. |
| **Blocked** | Thread is waiting for a resource or lock. |
| **Waiting** | Thread is waiting indefinitely until notified. |
| **Timed Waiting** | Thread is waiting for a specified time. |
| **Terminated** | Thread has completed execution or stopped. |

## 2. Real-Life Example 🌱➡️🌳
A seed (New) is planted, starts growing (Runnable), actively grows (Running), may get blocked by lack of water (Blocked), and finally withers (Terminated).

## 3. Thread Lifecycle Example in Java 📝
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        System.out.println("State: " + t1.getState()); // New
        t1.start();
        System.out.println("State: " + t1.getState()); // Runnable or Running
    }
}
```

## 4. Explanation of Key Methods 🛠️
- **`start()`** → Moves thread from New to Runnable.
- **`sleep(ms)`** → Moves thread to Timed Waiting.
- **`join()`** → Makes a thread wait until another completes.
- **`wait()` & `notify()`** → Manage inter-thread communication.

## 5. Conclusion 🎯
- Threads transition through multiple states based on execution flow.
- Properly handling states helps in efficient multi-threaded programming.
- Understanding lifecycle methods prevents deadlocks and performance issues.

By mastering thread lifecycle management, developers can create efficient Java applications! 🚀
