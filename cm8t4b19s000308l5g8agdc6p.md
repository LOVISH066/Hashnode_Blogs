## What is Abstraction? 🤔
Abstraction is an OOP principle that **hides implementation details** and only exposes the essential features of an object. It helps reduce complexity and increases code maintainability.

### Real-Life Example 🌍:
Think of an **ATM machine** 🏧:
- You insert your card, enter a PIN, and withdraw money.
- You don’t see the **internal banking operations** that process your request.
- The **complex logic is hidden**, but the essential functionality is available.

This is **abstraction**—hiding unnecessary details and exposing only what’s needed.

---

## How Abstraction Works? ⚙️
Abstraction in Java is achieved using:
1. **Abstract Classes**
2. **Interfaces**

---

## 1️⃣ Abstract Classes 📌
An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated. It may have **abstract methods** (without implementation) and **concrete methods** (with implementation).

### Example:
```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start(); // Abstract method
    void stop() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped");
    }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starting with key");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myCar = new Car();
        myCar.start();  // Output: Car starting with key
        myCar.stop();   // Output: Vehicle stopped
    }
}
```

---

## 2️⃣ Interfaces 📌
An **interface** is a collection of abstract methods. It provides **full abstraction**, meaning all methods are abstract (before Java 8).

### Example:
```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // Abstract method
}
class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.makeSound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

## Abstract Class vs Interface 🆚
| Feature           | Abstract Class 📌        | Interface 🎭          |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Methods        | Can have both abstract & concrete methods | Only abstract methods (before Java 8) |
| Variables      | Can have instance variables | Only `final` and `static` variables |
| Inheritance    | Can extend one class | Can implement multiple interfaces |

---

## Why Use Abstraction? 🤔
✅ **Hides complexity**: Users don’t need to know implementation details.  
✅ **Improves maintainability**: Changes in implementation don’t affect users.  
✅ **Enhances security**: Restricts direct data access.

---

## Conclusion 🎯
Abstraction simplifies programming by **hiding complexities** and exposing only necessary functionalities. It’s essential for writing clean and modular code! 🚀
