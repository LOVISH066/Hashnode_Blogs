## 1️⃣ What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? 🤔
**Answer:**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software around **objects** rather than **functions and logic**. It provides **reusability, modularity, and scalability** by using concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

---

## 2️⃣ What are the four main principles of OOP? 🏛️
**Answer:**
The four pillars of OOP are:
1. **Encapsulation** 🔒 - Hiding internal details and providing controlled access.
2. **Inheritance** 🧬 - Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
3. **Polymorphism** 🎭 - Enabling objects to take multiple forms (method overloading & overriding).
4. **Abstraction** 🕶️ - Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.

---

## 3️⃣ What is the difference between a class and an object? 🏗️
**Answer:**
| Feature  | Class 🏛️ | Object 🔹 |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Definition | A blueprint/template for creating objects | An instance of a class |
| Memory Usage | Does not consume memory | Consumes memory when instantiated |
| Example | `Car` class | `Tesla`, `BMW`, `Audi` objects |

---

## 4️⃣ What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding? 🔄
**Answer:**
| Feature | Method Overloading 🏗️ | Method Overriding 🎭 |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Definition | Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters | Redefining a method in a child class that exists in a parent class |
| Occurs At | Compile-time | Run-time |
| Example | `add(int a, int b)`, `add(int a, int b, int c)` | Parent: `draw()`, Child: `draw()` (overridden) |

---

## 5️⃣ What is an abstract class? 📌
**Answer:**
An **abstract class** is a class that **cannot be instantiated** and may contain **abstract methods** (methods without implementation).

#### Example:
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

✅ **Used for:** Providing a base structure for subclasses.

---

## 6️⃣ What is an interface? 🎭
**Answer:**
An **interface** in Java is a collection of **abstract methods** that a class can implement. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces provide **full abstraction** (before Java 8).

#### Example:
```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```
✅ **Used for:** Achieving multiple inheritance and abstraction.

---

## 7️⃣ What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface? 🆚
**Answer:**
| Feature | Abstract Class 📌 | Interface 🎭 |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Methods | Can have both abstract & concrete methods | Only abstract methods (before Java 8) |
| Variables | Can have instance variables | Only `final` and `static` variables |
| Inheritance | Supports single inheritance | Supports multiple inheritance |

---

## 8️⃣ What is a constructor? 🏗️
**Answer:**
A **constructor** is a special method that **initializes an object** when it is created.

#### Example:
```java
class Car {
    String brand;
    Car(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Tesla");
    }
}
```
✅ **Used for:** Initializing objects with default or specific values.

---

## 9️⃣ What is the `super` keyword in Java? 🔄
**Answer:**
The `super` keyword refers to the **parent class** and is used to call parent class methods or constructors.

#### Example:
```java
class Animal {
    String type = "Animal";
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void printType() {
        System.out.println(super.type);
    }
}
```
✅ **Used for:** Accessing parent class properties and methods.

---

## 🔟 What is the `this` keyword in Java? 📌
**Answer:**
The `this` keyword refers to the **current object** and is used to differentiate between instance and local variables.

#### Example:
```java
class Car {
    String brand;
    Car(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }
}
```
✅ **Used for:** Referring to the current class instance.

## Bonus: Advanced OOP Interview Questions 🎯
1. **What is multiple inheritance? Does Java support it?** (Java supports it via interfaces ✅)
2. **What is method hiding in Java?** (When a static method in a child class hides a static method from the parent class)
3. **What is the difference between composition and aggregation?** (Composition = strong association, Aggregation = weak association)
4. **What are design patterns in OOP?** (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
