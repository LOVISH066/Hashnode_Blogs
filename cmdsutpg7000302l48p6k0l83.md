## Why I’m Doing This

I’m Lovish, and I’m starting my career in tech from scratch — no CS degree, no big college name, no coding background.

Instead of going the traditional Software Developer or Full Stack route, I’ve chosen **Data Engineering**.

Why?  
Because data is the fuel of every modern business. Data Engineers make sure it’s collected, cleaned, stored, and delivered properly — and that’s a powerful role to be in.

## My 5-Month Goal 🚀
- Learn Python & SQL (core for any DE)
- Understand ETL processes and data pipelines
- Use tools like Airflow, Spark, and cloud storage (AWS/GCP)
- Build real-world projects and open source them
- Share everything I learn daily across Hashnode, LinkedIn, and Twitter

## What You Can Expect

I’ll be sharing:
- Daily learning summaries 📘
- Beginner-friendly explanations 🧠
- Real struggles and wins 🙃
- Weekly blog summaries like this

If you’re also starting from zero or learning in public, let’s connect and support each other! 🤝

Let’s go build something awesome! 💻💡
