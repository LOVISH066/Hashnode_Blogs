## Why Compare OOP Across Languages? 🤔
OOP principles are **universal**, but their implementation varies between languages. Understanding these differences helps in **choosing the right language** for specific projects and enhances **cross-language development skills**.

---

## 1️⃣ OOP in Java ☕
✅ Fully object-oriented with strong encapsulation.  
✅ Supports **interfaces and abstract classes**.  
✅ Uses **JVM** for cross-platform compatibility.  
✅ **Single inheritance**, but allows multiple inheritance via interfaces.  

### Example 📌:
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```
---

## 2️⃣ OOP in Python 🐍
✅ **Dynamic typing** (no need to declare variable types).  
✅ Supports **multiple inheritance** natively.  
✅ Uses **duck typing** (an object’s behavior determines its validity, not its class).  

### Example 📌:
```python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Animal makes a sound")
class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Bark")
```
---

## 3️⃣ OOP in C++ 🔵
✅ Supports both **procedural and object-oriented programming**.  
✅ Allows **multiple inheritance** and **operator overloading**.  
✅ Requires **manual memory management** (pointers).  

### Example 📌:
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        cout << "Animal makes a sound";
    }
};
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Bark";
    }
};
```
---

## 4️⃣ OOP in JavaScript 🌐
✅ **Prototype-based** OOP instead of class-based.  
✅ Introduced **class syntax** in ES6 for better readability.  
✅ Uses **closures and prototypal inheritance**.  

### Example 📌:
```javascript
class Animal {
    makeSound() {
        console.log("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
        console.log("Bark");
    }
}
```
---

## 5️⃣ OOP in C# ⚡
✅ Fully object-oriented with **strong type safety**.  
✅ Supports **interfaces, properties, and events**.  
✅ Has **garbage collection** for memory management.  

### Example 📌:
```csharp
class Animal {
    public virtual void MakeSound() {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}
class Dog : Animal {
    public override void MakeSound() {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark");
    }
}
```

## Key Differences 🆚
| Feature  | Java ☕ | Python 🐍 | C++ 🔵 | JavaScript 🌐 | C# ⚡ |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|------|
| Type System | Static | Dynamic | Static | Dynamic | Static |
| Inheritance | Single (Interfaces for multiple) | Multiple | Multiple | Prototypal | Single & Interfaces |
| Memory Management | Automatic (Garbage Collection) | Automatic | Manual (Pointers) | Automatic | Automatic |
| Operator Overloading | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## Conclusion 🎯
Each language implements OOP differently! Java and C# enforce **strict OOP**, while Python and JavaScript offer **more flexibility**. C++ gives **low-level control** but requires careful memory management. Choose the language based on your project needs! 🚀
