Multithreading is a crucial feature in Java that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program to maximize CPU utilization. Unlike process-based multitasking, thread-based multitasking enables efficient task execution within a single program.

## Why Multithreading? 🤔
- **Better CPU Utilization**: Multiple threads can run simultaneously, preventing CPU idle time.
- **Faster Execution**: Tasks that can run concurrently execute more quickly.
- **Improved Responsiveness**: Applications remain responsive while executing background tasks.

## Real-Life Example 🏃‍♂️📞
Think of a mobile phone: you can browse the internet while downloading a file and receiving notifications. These tasks run as separate threads, improving efficiency!

## Creating Threads in Java
Threads in Java can be created using two primary methods:
1. **Extending the Thread class**
2. **Implementing the Runnable interface**

### Example: Implementing Runnable
```java
class MyThread implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyThread());
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion 🎯
Multithreading is essential for modern applications requiring concurrency. Understanding how to implement it efficiently can lead to performance improvements in Java applications!
