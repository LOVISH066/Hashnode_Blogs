Today I began with the basics of Big Data and Hadoop.

### What I covered:
- Intro to Big Data (V's of Big Data)
- HDFS Architecture: how data is split and distributed across nodes
- Cloudera: a platform to work with Hadoop clusters

### Key Concepts:
- Big Data isn't just about size â€” it's about complexity and speed
- HDFS uses NameNodes and DataNodes to manage distributed storage
- Cloudera makes setting up a Hadoop environment easier for developers

Next up: Linux & HDFS commands, and an intro to MapReduce!
