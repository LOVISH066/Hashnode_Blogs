The **Thread Scheduler** in Java determines the order in which threads execute. Since Java does not guarantee a fixed execution order, understanding the scheduler helps in designing efficient multi-threaded applications.

## How Does the Thread Scheduler Work? 🔄
- The scheduler selects a thread from the **Runnable** state.
- It is based on factors like **priority**, **time slicing**, and **preemptive scheduling**.
- The behavior depends on the underlying **operating system and JVM implementation**.

## Thread Priority 🎚️
Threads have priority levels ranging from `1` (MIN_PRIORITY) to `10` (MAX_PRIORITY), with `5` (NORM_PRIORITY) as default.

### Example Code:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        t1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
        t2.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
📌 **Note:** The higher-priority thread `t2` has a better chance of executing first, but it's not guaranteed.

## Real-Life Example 🎟️🎢
Imagine a theme park ride where visitors with VIP passes (higher priority) get faster access, but sometimes regular ticket holders also get a turn.

## Thread Scheduling Methods 📋
1. **Yield():** Suggests the scheduler to switch execution to another thread.
2. **Sleep():** Pauses the thread for a specified time.
3. **Join():** Makes one thread wait until another completes execution.

### Example Using `yield()`
```java
class YieldExample extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
            Thread.yield();
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        YieldExample t1 = new YieldExample();
        YieldExample t2 = new YieldExample();
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion 🎯
- **Thread scheduling is unpredictable** and depends on JVM implementation.
- **Setting thread priorities** gives hints but does not enforce execution order.
- **Use scheduling methods wisely** to control thread execution flow.

By understanding the thread scheduler, developers can optimize Java applications for better performance! 🚀
