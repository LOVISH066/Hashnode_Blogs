## What Are SOLID Principles? 🤔
SOLID is a set of five design principles that help developers create **scalable, maintainable, and flexible** object-oriented software. These principles make the code **easier to understand, modify, and extend**.

### Why Use SOLID? ✅
- Reduces **tight coupling** between components.
- Increases **code reusability** and **scalability**.
- Makes software **easier to test and maintain**.

---

## 1️⃣ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 🔍
**A class should have only one reason to change.**

### Example 📌:
Bad Design ❌: A class handling both user data and sending emails.
```java
class User {
    void saveToDatabase() { /* Save user */ }
    void sendEmail() { /* Send email */ }
}
```
Better Design ✅: Split into two classes.
```java
class User {
    void saveToDatabase() { /* Save user */ }
}
class EmailService {
    void sendEmail(User user) { /* Send email */ }
}
```
✅ Each class has **one responsibility**.

---

## 2️⃣ Open/Closed Principle (OCP) 🚪
**Software components should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

### Example 📌:
Bad Design ❌: Adding more `if` conditions to support new shapes.
```java
class AreaCalculator {
    double calculateArea(Object shape) {
        if (shape instanceof Circle) { /* Circle area logic */ }
        else if (shape instanceof Square) { /* Square area logic */ }
    }
}
```
Better Design ✅: Use **polymorphism**.
```java
interface Shape {
    double getArea();
}
class Circle implements Shape {
    public double getArea() { return Math.PI * radius * radius; }
}
class Square implements Shape {
    public double getArea() { return side * side; }
}
```
✅ Now we can **add new shapes** without modifying existing code.

---

## 3️⃣ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 🔄
**Subclasses should be replaceable for their base classes without breaking the system.**

### Example 📌:
Bad Design ❌: A `Bird` superclass with `fly()` method—causes issues with non-flying birds.
```java
class Bird {
    void fly() { /* Default flying logic */ }
}
class Penguin extends Bird {
    void fly() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly!"); }
}
```
Better Design ✅: Separate into different hierarchies.
```java
abstract class Bird {}
interface Flyable { void fly(); }
class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable {
    public void fly() { /* Sparrow flying logic */ }
}
class Penguin extends Bird {
    /* No fly method needed */
}
```
✅ Now, `Penguin` doesn't violate the expected behavior.

---

## 4️⃣ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 🎭
**Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.**

### Example 📌:
Bad Design ❌: A `Worker` interface with too many methods.
```java
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}
class Robot implements Worker {
    public void work() { /* Robot working */ }
    public void eat() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Robots don't eat!"); }
}
```
Better Design ✅: Separate interfaces.
```java
interface Workable { void work(); }
interface Eatable { void eat(); }
class Robot implements Workable {
    public void work() { /* Robot working */ }
}
class Human implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() { /* Human working */ }
    public void eat() { /* Human eating */ }
}
```
✅ Now, classes only **implement relevant methods**.

---

## 5️⃣ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 🔄
**High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**

### Example 📌:
Bad Design ❌: Directly instantiating a dependency.
```java
class EmailService {
    void sendEmail() { /* Send email */ }
}
class Notification {
    private EmailService emailService = new EmailService();
}
```
Better Design ✅: Use dependency injection.
```java
interface MessageService {
    void sendMessage();
}
class EmailService implements MessageService {
    public void sendMessage() { /* Send email */ }
}
class Notification {
    private MessageService messageService;
    public Notification(MessageService messageService) {
        this.messageService = messageService;
    }
}
```
✅ Now, `Notification` can work with **any message service** (Email, SMS, Push Notification).

## Summary Table 📜
| Principle | Meaning | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **SRP** | One class, one responsibility | Better maintainability |
| **OCP** | Open for extension, closed for modification | Easier to scale |
| **LSP** | Subtypes replace base types | Avoids unexpected behaviors |
| **ISP** | Interfaces should be specific | No unnecessary dependencies |
| **DIP** | Depend on abstractions, not concretes | Flexible architecture |

---

## Conclusion 🎯
By following **SOLID principles**, we create software that is **flexible, scalable, and maintainable**. Mastering these concepts will make you a **better OOP developer**! 🚀
