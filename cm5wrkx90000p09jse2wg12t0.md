Effective decision-making requires structure. Frameworks bring clarity and consistency to complex choices. Let’s explore three game-changing approaches.

---

## A/B Testing

Compare two product versions to see which performs better.

Example:

* **Hypothesis:** Changing a CTA button from blue to green will increase clicks. 🔵➡️🟢
    
* **Execution:** Randomly assign users to Version A (blue) or Version B (green).
    
* **Outcome:** The green button gets 25% more clicks.

## The RICE Scoring Model

Prioritize features based on:

* **Reach:** How many users will benefit? 🌍
    
* **Impact:** How significant is the benefit? 💥
    
* **Confidence:** How sure are you? 🧐
    
* **Effort:** How much work is needed? 🛠️
    

Example:

A SaaS team prioritized a dashboard feature (RICE: 4,800) over a minor bug fix (RICE: 3,000).

## Kano Model

Classify features into:

* **Basic Needs:** Must-haves (e.g., app stability). 🛡️
    
* **Performance Needs:** Features with proportional satisfaction (e.g., faster load times). ⚡
    
* **Excitement Needs:** Delightful extras (e.g., personalized dashboards). 🎉
    

📍 **Example:** A car rental app allowed users to select specific car models, boosting bookings by **25%**. 🚗
