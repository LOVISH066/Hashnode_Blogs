## What is a Class? 🏛️
A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.

### Example 📌:
Think of a **Car Factory** 🏭. The factory (class) defines the design, but the actual cars (objects) are made from that design.

#### Java Example:
```java
class Car {
    String brand;
    int speed;
    
    void accelerate() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is accelerating!");
    }
}
```

## What is an Object? 🔹
An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity created from the class blueprint.

### Example 📌:
From the **Car Factory** analogy, an actual Tesla Model S or Ford Mustang is an object of the `Car` class.

#### Java Example:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();  // Object creation
        myCar.brand = "Tesla";
        myCar.speed = 200;
        myCar.accelerate();  // Calling method
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Tesla is accelerating!
```

## Key Differences: Class vs Object 🆚
| Feature       | Class 🏛️             | Object 🚗           |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Definition   | A blueprint/template | An actual instance |
| Memory Usage | Doesn’t take memory  | Takes memory space |
| Purpose      | Defines structure    | Represents real entity |

## Why Use Classes & Objects? 🤔
✅ **Modularity**: Breaks down complex systems into manageable parts.  
✅ **Code Reusability**: The same class can be used to create multiple objects.  
✅ **Scalability**: New features can be added easily by modifying classes.

## Conclusion 🎯
Classes and objects form the foundation of OOP. By defining reusable blueprints (classes), we can efficiently create and manipulate objects in our programs! 🚀
