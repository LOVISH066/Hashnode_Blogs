## What is Encapsulation? 🤔
Encapsulation is the process of **bundling data (variables) and methods (functions)** that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It helps in **restricting direct access** to some details and only exposing the necessary parts of an object.

### Real-Life Example 🌍:
Think of a **capsule pill** 💊. The medicine inside is protected and can only be accessed in a controlled way. Similarly, in OOP, we hide certain data and provide controlled access via methods.

## How Encapsulation Works? ⚙️
Encapsulation is implemented using **access modifiers**:
- `private` → Accessible only within the class.
- `public` → Accessible from anywhere.
- `protected` → Accessible within the same package or subclasses.

#### Example in Java 📌:
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Private variable
    
    // Constructor
    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }
    
    // Public method to access private variable
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    
    // Public method to modify private variable
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount(1000);
        myAccount.deposit(500);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + myAccount.getBalance());
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Deposited: 500
Balance: 1500
```

## Why Use Encapsulation? 🤔
✅ **Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized modifications.  
✅ **Code Maintainability**: Hides complex details and allows controlled access.  
✅ **Modularity**: Makes the code cleaner and more organized.

## Key Differences: Encapsulation vs Data Hiding 🆚
| Feature           | Encapsulation 🔒          | Data Hiding 🕶️         |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Definition      | Bundling data and methods | Restricting access to data |
| Accessibility  | Allows controlled access | Completely hides data |
| Example       | `private` variables with `getters/setters` | `private` variables with no access methods |

---

## Conclusion 🎯
Encapsulation is a fundamental OOP principle that ensures **data security, modularity, and maintainability**. It allows us to control access to an object's properties, making software **more robust and scalable**. 🚀
