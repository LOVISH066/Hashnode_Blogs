In Java, you can create threads using two main approaches:
1. **Extending the `Thread` class`**
2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**

Both approaches have their advantages and are used based on specific requirements.

## 1. Extending the Thread Class 🏗️
- A subclass inherits from `Thread` and overrides the `run()` method.
- Less flexible since Java allows single inheritance.

### Example Code
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

### Real-Life Example 🚗🔧
Imagine an assembly line where each machine (thread) performs a specific task like welding or painting.

## 2. Implementing the Runnable Interface 🔄
- More flexible as the class can extend other classes while implementing `Runnable`.
- Recommended for better scalability.

### Example Code
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread is running...");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

### Real-Life Example 🏢
A company where multiple employees (threads) work independently but share resources like databases.

## Choosing the Right Approach 🤔
| Feature            | Extending `Thread` | Implementing `Runnable` |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Multiple Inheritance Support | ❌ No  | ✅ Yes |
| Code Reusability | ❌ Less  | ✅ More |
| Memory Overhead  | ✅ Low | ✅ Low |

## Conclusion 🎯
- Use `Thread` when no other class needs to be extended.
- Use `Runnable` for better flexibility and reusability.

By selecting the right approach, developers can optimize performance and maintainability in Java applications!
